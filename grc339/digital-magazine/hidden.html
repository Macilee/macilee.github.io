        <h2>A look into the hidden world of freight art</h2>
        <p>Books on graffiti and graffiti writers are no new thing. There is no mystery, especially to the graffiti writers, that mass culture is eating this stuff by the pound. While no politician in this country is looking to legalize graffiti, (that's a good thing) the use of graffiti style logos and imaging has become abundant in today's society.</p>
        <p>There is no arguing the impact that graffiti, both as an art form and a cultural movement, has had on the larger American popular culture. As graffiti continues to grow, specialization within the culture has inevitably started taking place. The wall writers, the bombers, the piecers, the throw-up kids, of course the train writers, and more specifically the freight writers. Graffiti on freight trains has been called the heir to subway graffiti. When the life of the subways ended and the regularly scheduled trains were pulled from service the estate was passed on to the fresher, larger railroad cousin, freights. "FREIGHT TRAIN GRAFFITI" is the only definitive history of this exciting and distinct branch of the larger graffiti culture. "FREIGHT TRAIN GRAFFITI," is jam-packed with hundreds of never seen before photographs and features in-depth interviews with more than 100 freight writers and train enthusiasts.</p>
        <p>For us, it was our goal to put something together that presented as non-biased of a perspective as possible. Truth be told, this is impossible. With any graffiti writer they are giving you their slant on the topic. It's in the nature of all graffiti writers to "rep" themselves and their crews. It's part of what makes graffiti so great, the loyalty and camaraderie. The challenge became to talk to as many freight writers as possible, from the first writers to hit freights to the most prominent and innovative pioneers of the art form. This was a nightmare. Hours and hours of tracking people down, phone call after phone call, email after email to find people that for all intents and purposes don't want to be found. Persistence pays off and eventually we had spoken with enough heavyweights that others really started to come around and were amazingly candid with their interviews and thoughts. It's really their lack of fear and willingness to share their stories that make "FREIGHT TRAIN GRAFFITI," the amazing project that it is.</p>

        <p>Quotes like these are helped along by more than 1000 images, 800 of which are color shots of the most influential freight train graffiti writers to date. "FREIGHT TRAIN GRAFFITI" chronicles how a fad in a few cities grew into a full-blown national phenomenon, from the first writers to ever paint freight through its spread in popularity leading up to the mass explosion of freight writers to surface in the mid 90s. This is not a book about what you will see on freights today -- this is a book on why you even see graffiti on freights at all. We must sincerely thank all of the writers who contributed their time, thoughts and photos, which people donated by the thousands. We'd also like to thank Michael Delahaut for his amazing design skills, as well as Caleb Neelon, Caroline Ryder, Simon Stienhardt, SMITH, ZEPHYR, KET, Bill Daniels, Ted Favin, Dave Schubert, and everyone who contributed along the way.</p>
