        <h2>The “Sistine Chapel” of SAMO graffiti</h2>
        <p>South 11th Street comprises two short blocks between Kent and Berry Streets, right on the cusp of Hasidic Williamsburg. “It was pretty much a ruin when I moved in,” Jim Fleming says of 53–55, the six-story factory turned artists’ lofts where he has lived with his wife, Lewanne Jones, since 1982. Today, the building is generic mid-tier real estate; the once sprawling lofts have been converted, for the most part, to one- and two-bedroom apartments that rent for around $3,000 a month. The loading dock to the freight elevator that used to keep residents up at all hours has been cinderblocked over, but you can still see its outline through the paint.</p>

        <p>Beyond their association with Basquiat, the SAMO tags at 53–55 and 65 South 11th Street were reminders of a time when 1,000-person parties would go on until 6 a.m. in abandoned warehouses by the East River and when artists and their neighbors, mostly working-class immigrants from Puerto Rico and Poland, could actually afford to live in Williamsburg and neighboring Greenpoint. The building today looks nothing as it once did. There are about nine renovated units on each level, the same amount of space that once held two artists’ lofts, like the one Fleming and Jones share, which still has its original wood floors and exposed beams.At first, the couple was nonchalant about the graffiti, but the tags came to feel special as the years passed. The former elevator operator would proudly point them out every time someone new came in, and as word got around that there was a Basquiat in the building, people started to come just to see the tags. You didn’t have to pay $35 (or $65 to skip the line) to see a Basquiat; it was art history in the wild. “Those things were a dime a dozen back in the day,” Jones says. “Honestly, you know, you could see that everywhere.”</p>
