        <p>When Reno-based freight train graffiti artist Biserk gets bored, he flips open his smartphone and tracks trains, constantly on the lookout for railcars stationed in his favorite “chill” spots. For Biserk, tracking trains is a hobby to fuel his passion, his first love, his lifestyle. A lifestyle that drives Biserk to park in faraway rest stops all over the west coast so he can hike into the wilderness to paint trains where they slumber for weeks at a time. For graffiti artists dotting every corner of the globe, painting isn’t a hobby. It’s a lifestyle. A lifestyle that demands discipline and vigilance. Creativity and gutsiness. A deep understanding of risk versus reward and a little knowledge of modern graffiti history. Also, coming up with a nifty name. A fresh nom de plume writers sprinkle on trash cans, bathroom stalls, rest stops, and abandoned industrial areas. A unique code name that essentially becomes a painter’s de facto first name among fellow graffiti artists. Biserk, a freight train artist who’s been painting graffiti nearly his entire life, has held the same name for as long as he can remember. </p>
        <p>“You may have seen my head in your city,” says Jaber, a veteran of the train graffiti game who’s been bombing freights for over 20 years. “I really don’t have to travel to your neck of the woods. I can just [paint] the freights and they’ll do the work for me.” The head Jaber means is his now-famous two-tone throw-up of a spiky-haired, mouthless, frowning boy who looks ready to throw down at any moment. Jaber describes the logo as “kind of a mutt of many different characters” from 1970’s and 80’s street art, and he estimates he’s put up “a few hundred thousand, maybe more” on walls and trains across the U.S.</p>

        <p>New York City in the 1970s was like a giant delicious bowl of tasty subculture soup. With each ingredient seamlessly playing off the other, creating an exciting, distinctive dish. Graffiti evolved with other burgeoning subcultures like hip-hop, breakdancing, DJing, and urban fashion to create something new and unique. It didn’t take long for the Big Apple’s creation to reach the west coast. By the 1980s, Los Angeles’s sea of concrete and cavalcade of buses were splattered with art from legendary painters like Risk, Slick, Frame, and Chaka. Nowadays, graffiti is everywhere, sprouting up in every corner of the globe. From middle America to the Middle East, graffiti writers utilize aerosol spray paint to create public art displays. Some spread their pseudonym far and wide, while others use graffiti to make a poignant political statement. No matter how you slice it, graffiti is global. And like any other global subculture, members relish any opportunity to learn more about their cultures.</p>
        <p>“Graffiti’s like a religion,” said Biserk. “It’s been around me since I was like six years old.” Graffiti culture influences many facets of a painter’s life, impacting their friend group, musical selection, lingo, fashion, day-to-day activities, and career choice. “I don’t know where I’d be without graffiti,” said Adam Kienas, a professional artist who at one point on his journey exchanged his paint can for a digital brush and tattoo gun. “I think about painting non-stop or creating art non-stop. Everything in my life revolves around it.” Graffiti culture isn’t a monolith. Different artists have different opinions about what’s legal, what’s ethical, what’s political, and what’s downright vandalism. Some artists are hardliners who take getting written over extremely personally, while others don’t care.</p>
        <p>“When you do a train, you typically want to tape off the numbers of the train,” said Kienas, the retired graffiti artist. “You mask them so when you peel them off when you’re done painting, if everything’s still legible with all the information they need, they don’t paint over the graffiti.” Some rules act as advice. “Don’t park somewhere that looks suspicious,” said Biserk, who leaned up from his relaxed pose to emphasize, “and don’t use a flashlight in the dark.” And there are rules dedicated to history.“Don’t go over legendary shit,” said Biserk, returning to his relaxed position while scribbling tags on a piece of paper. “Shit that’s been there for ten years.” But the most crucial rule is apparent. Don’t be lame.“Your tag, your signature shit has to be on point, nice, funky, it has to be on lock. Your throw up, your piece, your colors, or else people are going to go over your shit,” said Biserk. “If they see my stuff that is fresh and the next train has something with only two colors, weak shit, they’ll definitely go over that.”</p>
        <p>“Graffiti is so immensely popular. It’s on all your favorite brands. All your favorite clothing brands use it,” said Kienas. “Any successful artist in Reno that’s under 35 has dabbled in graffiti in some way, or people are asking them to do it because it’s in demand.” Still, some artists will never ditch writing graffiti illegally, no matter how robust the market is for their talents. “There’s real graffiti artists out there, people that are going to be doing this and be a part of this, or at least say they’re a part of this until the day they die,” said Kienas. “And when you come across them, you know it.” Biserk agrees.“When I started doing freight trains, I would go out to yards and run into people,” said Biserk. “I would run into older cats where I’m like ‘damn bro, how old are you?’ And they’d be like forty and have two kids,” said Biserk. “One of them had a daughter my age, and he still writes.” Biserk just might be one of those lifers who will never abandon his first true love and passion, no matter the risk. Biserk is addicted to the way painting graffiti makes him feel.“Stress-free, you’re just in your own world, man I love it,” said Biserk. “I’m going to do it until the wheels fall off.”</p>
