        <h2>Trains, the moving canvas</h2>
        <p>“STEEL IS REAL”, a proverb often used by graffiti artists the world over. But not every country has an accessible metro or passenger train system possible to paint graffiti on. Freight trains are that “other” steel that a lot of artists turn to develop their creativity. And with long travel routes and endless connections through states, countries and continents, why not? In the high security world of camera’s, guards, sensors and unscalable fences, the prospect of more time and less stress to paint is an inviting one. For those well practiced in the art of freight train painting, eventually preference to painting freights can occur when the artwork being created becomes more suitable for the windowless giant metal monsters. Watching your name go by 6 months, 12 months or even years later is a novel luxury not often possible in other disciplines of graffiti.</p>
        <p>“You may have seen my head in your city,” says Jaber, a veteran of the train graffiti game who’s been bombing freights for over 20 years. “I really don’t have to travel to your neck of the woods. I can just [paint] the freights and they’ll do the work for me.” The head Jaber means is his now-famous two-tone throw-up of a spiky-haired, mouthless, frowning boy who looks ready to throw down at any moment. Jaber describes the logo as “kind of a mutt of many different characters” from 1970’s and 80’s street art, and he estimates he’s put up “a few hundred thousand, maybe more” on walls and trains across the U.S.</p>

        <p>Watching the name you painted with Montana GOLD, Montana BLACK or Montana WHITE, go by over and over again, can be a beautiful thing. Each time with a little more dust, a little more rust and a little more romance then the last time.</p>
