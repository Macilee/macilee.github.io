                    <p>Ever since golden era subway graffiti in the USA ‘died’, writers in America have found a rolling alternative in freight trains. From what I’ve noticed, those into freights are really, REALLY into these big metal giants – it’s an obsession.Which is why the current Beyond The Streets exhibition in New York City could not exist without some nod to freight culture. And nod they have. Alongside a section of freight monikers, the show features a display of model trains carrying the names of selected heavy hitters.</p>
                                            

                     <p>The Freight Train Graffiti section in Beyond The Streets is curated by Tim Conlon, and has evolved from earlier displays. The first iteration was showcased at ‘Art in the Streets’ at the MOCA LA in 2011 (curated by Jeffrey Deitch, Roger Gastman, and Aaron Rose). The MOCA show was the first large-scale graffiti/ street art show in a US museum and it was a big deal for freight train graffiti to be featured in a real art museum.</p>

                    <p>Fast forward to 2018 and the trains were included in the first Beyond The Streets (a major exhibition curated by Roger Gastman) show in Los Angeles, and then again in Brooklyn, New York in 2019. I caught up with Tim Conlon during the New York leg of Beyond The Streets to get the lowdown on the show and his evolution as an artist. If you haven’t made it to the show yet, be quick. It finishes this Sunday 29 September.</p>

                    <p>You curated the G scale train exhibit within the MOCA show, can you tell the story of how that came together? This was 2011, how significant was that moment?Roger is an old graffiti friend of mine from growing up near Washington DC, so we have known each other since the early 90s. He knew that I had an extensive network and knowledge of freight train writers. About six months before the opening at LA MOCA, I received a call from Roger who had an interesting proposition: he asked me to curate the freight train display as part of the graffiti timeline in the exhibit.</p>
                    
                    <p>Roger had seen the model boxcars that I had painted for smaller gallery shows and thought it would be great to select a group of graffiti artists to paint a batch of trains for the museum. I was excited about the opportunity, but I knew I would have a lot of work ahead of me because of the scale of the exhibition. Being responsible for getting these art pieces to a bunch of different writers who may have never painted a model train before was a little stressful initially, but it came together really well.These model trains then resurfaced last year for the Beyond The Streets show in Los Angeles. What was different between the display in the original Art in the Streets show versus the Beyond The Streets LA and NY shows? </p>

                    <p>Initially there were twelve G scale model trains in Art in the Streets. For Beyond The Streets in LA we added six new boxcars and the original engine that was supposed to pull the MOCA trains on a track. For Beyond The Streets in NYC, we added one new boxcar, so the current total is 19 painted trains.</p>

                    <p>How did you choose the writers to paint the model cars for these shows? First MOCA, and then the two Beyond The Streets shows?When I was asked to do the MOCA show, I immediately tallied in my head over 50 train writers that I thought should be included, but I was going to be restricted to just twelve trains to display.In order to narrow down the list of potential artists, we decided the writers should be pioneers from the early 90s when graffiti was just starting to take off on rolling stock. The other decision was to try to cover different regions of the United States to have a diverse representation of freight trains painted during that era. A few of the cities covered included Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Atlanta, Jacksonville, Miami, Minneapolis, Milwaukee, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Oakland, Portland, and Seattle.I asked a handful of prominent freight writers to come up with their list of who they thought were significant writers in the early freight scene. That way it was easy to see whose names repeatedly popped up on multiple lists. After much polling and debate, a total of 24 artists were chosen so we could feature two on each of the twelve boxcars.</p>

                     <p>I know you added some extras for the New York show. How important was the legacy of freight writing when selecting artists? Roger had been planning the first Beyond The Streets show for many years, so he had already envisioned it as a follow up to Art in the Streets. He asked me to participate and show some of the train paintings I had been working on and we decided to exhibit MOCA’s trains and add some new ones to that collection.I felt there were a few gaps in the boxcars that were displayed at Art in the Streets. Some writers didn’t have an interest in doing model trains, while others we couldn’t get ahold of at the time. I went back to those original lists of writers and crews that we discussed being in the museum show and started reaching out to people. It was great to include twelve more freight writers we wanted for the original MOCA collection, as well as fill in some of the missing sections of that early legacy.</p>
