        <h2>Talking Freight Train Graffiti at Beyond The Streets, NYC</h2>
        <p>Ever since golden era subway graffiti in the USA ‘died’, writers in America have found a rolling alternative in freight trains. From what I’ve noticed, those into freights are really, REALLY into these big metal giants – it’s an obsession. Which is why the current Beyond The Streets exhibition in New York City could not exist without some nod to freight culture. And nod they have. Alongside a section of freight monikers, the show features a display of model trains carrying the names of selected heavy hitters. The Freight Train Graffiti section in Beyond The Streets is curated by Tim Conlon, and has evolved from earlier displays. The first iteration was showcased at ‘Art in the Streets’ at the MOCA LA in 2011 (curated by Jeffrey Deitch, Roger Gastman, and Aaron Rose). The MOCA show was the first large-scale graffiti/ street art show in a US museum and it was a big deal for freight train graffiti to be featured in a real art museum. Fast forward to 2018 and the trains were included in the first Beyond The Streets (a major exhibition curated by Roger Gastman) show in Los Angeles, and then again in Brooklyn, New York in 2019. I caught up with Tim Conlon during the New York leg of Beyond The Streets to get the lowdown on the show and his evolution as an artist. If you haven’t made it to the show yet, be quick. It finishes this Sunday 29 September.</p>
        <p>How did you choose the writers to paint the model cars for these shows? First MOCA, and then the two Beyond The Streets shows? When I was asked to do the MOCA show, I immediately tallied in my head over 50 train writers that I thought should be included, but I was going to be restricted to just twelve trains to display. In order to narrow down the list of potential artists, we decided the writers should be pioneers from the early 90s when graffiti was just starting to take off on rolling stock. The other decision was to try to cover different regions of the United States to have a diverse representation of freight trains painted during that era. A few of the cities covered included Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Atlanta, Jacksonville, Miami, Minneapolis, Milwaukee, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Oakland, Portland, and Seattle. I asked a handful of prominent freight writers to come up with their list of who they thought were significant writers in the early freight scene. That way it was easy to see whose names repeatedly popped up on multiple lists. After much polling and debate, a total of 24 artists were chosen so we could feature two on each of the twelve boxcars.</p>

        <p>I started when I was in college in Baltimore back in 1993 and hanging out with friends who were skaters and graffiti writers. We ran all over the city looking for skate spots and ended up discovering a lot of abandoned spots with really old graffiti pieces. Baltimore has a long history of graffiti with its own unique style and I quickly became enamored with learning all about it. I started to document every old tag and piece I could find. This became an obsession and it was only a matter of time until I made the transition from observer to practitioner. I have a long-held interest in freight trains and its infrastructure. There was so much commercial cargo heading from Baltimore Harbor to other cities across the country that trains were everywhere and provided a simple means to spread your work across the country. After college – like thousands of others – I joined the tech boom. In short order I went from design and production to managing other artists and leading teams in marketing and PR firms. I began to understand how once again I was operating in a world where icons, colors, and brands are king. And so goes the story that defines my artistic style. </p>
